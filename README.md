# Franklin Library

This repository contains the Franklin Library plugin for the sidekick.

The franklin library simplifies authoring workflows for users by

* Providing a surface for franklin sites to display plugins right in context with their authoring tool (Word, Gdocs).
* Includes an out of the box set of plugins for customers to utilize (blocks, tags)
* The `block` plugin provides a list of all blocks and block variations to authors in an intuitive manner and removes the need for authors to have to remember or search for every variation of a block.
* It can aggregate plugins across multiple inherited projects into a single place.
